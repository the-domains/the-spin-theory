  A few days ago, someone asked me a question I wasn’t ready for. They asked,
  “how many days of the last year can you remember?” It was an interesting
  question and, in his opinion, some sort of measure of the quality of your life
  - five being the measure of success. In all honesty, I didn’t have a great
  answer at the time, but here goes nothing:

# 5 days
![Tracks near Oltorf - Austin, TX](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/030e92b4-f94b-4432-8ef5-134f8abb2430.jpg)

A few days ago, someone asked me a question I wasn't ready for. They asked, "how many days of the last year can you remember?" It was an interesting question and, in his opinion, some sort of measure of the quality of your life - five being the measure of success. In all honesty, I didn't have a great answer at the time, but here goes nothing:

1. The day someone asked me if I could name 5 days I remembered in the last year.
2. Dreamhack weekend.
3. The most ridiculous steak dinner I've ever had.
4. The day I left Miami.
5. The day she kissed me on the cheek.

To be fair, there's a lot more and one year isn't far enough to go back - maybe another post. In any case, it's fun to think about.
