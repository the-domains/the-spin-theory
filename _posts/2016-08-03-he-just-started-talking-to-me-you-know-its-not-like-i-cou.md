  He just started talking to me, you know. Itâ€™s not like I could stop him.
  Several sheets to the wind, he was going to say what he wanted to say.

He just started talking to me, you know. It's not like I could stop him. Several sheets to the wind, he was going to say what he wanted to say.

I'm still not simple enough, I suppose. I could get rid of every last thing I owned and still not get it like he did. Like some sort of drunken Buddha, he had transcended us all.

He'll die out here, twenty feet away from the memorial to other like him. But he'll listen to that water all the way into the afterlife.
